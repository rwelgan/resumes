Welcome to my resume repository on github.

I am currently looking for work as a software engineer.  I have experience:

- Managing small teams 
- Developing Java software
- Managing Oracle and DB2 databases
- Improving system performance

I'll keep this git repository up-to-date as I learn new skills.

Thank you for your interest.
